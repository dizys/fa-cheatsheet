# Processes and Threads

A "processor" can only run one unit of execution (process/thread) at a time. The
processor is switched (context switch) among multiple applications so all will
appear to be progressing (albeit potentially at reduced speed). The processor
and I/O devices can be used efficiently: When application performs I/O, the
processor can be used for a different application.

## What is a process?

An abstraction of a running program.

### The Process Model

- A process has a program, input, output, and state (data).
- A process is an instance of an executing program and includes
  - Variables ( memory )
  - Code
  - Program counter ( really hardware resource)
  - Registers
  - ...

### Process: a running program

A process includes:

- Address space
- Process table entries (state, registers): Open files, thread(s) state,
  resources field

A process tree:

- A created two child processes, B and C
- B created three child processes, D, E and F

```
     A
   /   \
   B    C
 / | \
 D E F
```

### Address Space

- Defines where sections of data and code are located in 32 or 64 address space.
- Defines protection of such sections: ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute
- Confined "private" addressing concept: requires form of address virtualization

![Address Space Example](https://209070276-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FkHa2lHxqa0pWCOMxKmtW%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-2b2d5da10bfde542f15ecc2f66e8058c61f52aaa%2Faddress-space.png?alt=media)

### Process Creation

- System initialization
  - At boot time
  - Foreground
- Background (daemons)
- Execution of a process creation system call by a running process
- A user request
- A batch job
- Created by OS to provide a service
- Interactive login

### Process Termination

- Normal exit (voluntary)
- Error exit (voluntary)
- Fatal error (involuntary)
- Killed by another process (involuntary)

## Implementation of Processes

- OS maintains a process table `Process procs[];`
- An array (or a hash table) of structures
- One entry per process (pid is the uniq id)

## Implementation of Processes: Process Control Block (PCB)

- Contains the process elements
- It is possible to interrupt a running process and later resume execution as if
  the interrupt had not occurred → state
- Created and managed by the operating system
- Key tool that allows support for multiple processes

Includes: Identifier, state, priority, program counter, memory pointers, context
data, I/O status information and accounting information.

## Fork

Creation of a new process by `fork()`. Executing a program in that new process.
Signal notifications.

The kernel boot manually creates ONE process (the init process, pid=0) and all
other processes are created by `fork()`.

### `fork()`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  pid_t pid = fork(); // syscall that creates new PCB and duplicates Address Space
  if (pid == 0) {
    // child process
  } else if (pid > 0) {
    // parent process
  } else {
    // fork failed
    printf("fork() failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }
}
```

### `execv()`

The `exec()` family of functions replaces the current process image with a new
process image.

## Process State Model: Five-State Model

### Using Queues to Manage Processes

![Multiple blocked queues](https://209070276-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FkHa2lHxqa0pWCOMxKmtW%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-611b89c2852039603ab78a20608aeae64d7f0074%2Fusing-queues-to-manage-processes-multiple.png?alt=media)

## Multiprogramming

- One CPU and several processes
- CPU switches from process to process quickly

Running the same program several times will not result in the same execution
times due to:

- interrupts
- multi-programming

## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

- Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in
  overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be
  running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core
  machine.
- Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore
  processor.

## Threads

- Multiple threads of control within a process: unique execution
- All threads of a process share the same address space and resources (with
  exception of stack)

### Why Threads?

- For some applications many activities can happen at once:
  - With threads, programming becomes easier
    - Otherwise application needs to actively manage different logical
      executions in the process
    - This requires significant state management
  - Benefit applications with I/O and processing that can overlap
- Lighter weight than processes
- Can be used to implement concurrency
  - Faster to create and restore: we just really need a stack and an execution
    unit, but don't have to create new address space etc.

### Processes vs. Threads

- Process groups resources: Address Space, files
- Threads are entities scheduled for execution on CPU
- Threads can be in any of several states: running, blocked, ready, and
  terminated (remember the process state model?)
- No protections among threads (unlike processes) [Why?] → this is important
- The unit of dispatching is referred to as a thread or lightweight process
  (lwp)
- The unit of resource ownership is referred to as a process or task
  (unfortunately in linux struct task represents both a process and thread)
- Multithreading: The ability of an OS to support multiple, concurrent paths of
  execution within a single process
- Process is the unit for resource allocation and a unit of protection.
- Process has its own (one) address space.
- A thread has:
  - an execution state (Running, Ready, etc.)
  - saved thread context when not running
  - an execution stack
  - some per-thread static storage for local variables
  - access to the memory and resources of its process (all threads of a process
    share this)

## Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)

Thread management is done by the kernel. No thread management is done by the
application.

Advantages:

- The kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process
  on multiple processors
- If one thread in a process is blocked, the kernel can schedule another thread
  of the same process
- Kernel routines can be multithreaded

Disadvantages:

- The transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process
  requires a mode switch to the kernel

## Implementing Threads in Kernel Space

- Kernel knows about and manages the threads
- No runtime is needed in each process
- Creating/destroying/(other thread related operations) a thread involves a
  system call

Advantages:

- When a thread blocks (due to page fault or blocking system calls) the OS can
  execute another thread from the same process

Disadvantages:

- Scalability (operating systems had limited memory dedicated to them)
- ~~Cost of system call is very high~~ (Disagree because if you want to
  implement interruption to do thread scheduling you have to use
  `signal(SIGVTALARM)` which is much more expensive.)

## User-Level Threads (ULTs)

- All thread management is done by the application
- Initially developed to run on kernels that are not multithreading capable
- The kernel is not aware of the existence of threads

### Implementing Threads in User Space

- Threads are implemented by a library
- Kernel knows nothing about threads
- Each process needs its own private thread table in userspace
- Thread table is managed by the runtime system

### Advantages

- Thread switch does not require kernel-mode
- Scheduling (of threads) can be application specific
- Can run on any OS
- Scales better

### Disadvantages

- A system-call by one thread can block all threads of that process
- Page fault blocks the whole process
- In pure ULT, multithreading cannot take advantage of multiprocessing

## PCB vs. TCB

Process Control Block handles global process resources. Thread Control Block
handles thread execution resources.

| Per process items           | Per thread items |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Address space               | Program counter  |
| Global variables            | Registers        |
| Open files                  | Stack            |
| Child processes             | State            |
| Pending alarms              |                  |
| Signals and signal handlers |                  |
| Accounting information      |                  |

## 1:1, M:1, M:N

Thread Models are also knows as general ratio of user threads over kernels
threads

- 1:1: each user thread == kernel thread
- M:1: user level thread mode
- M:N: hybrid model

## Context Switch

Scenarios:

- Current process (or thread) blocks _OR_
- Preemption

Operations to be done:

- Must release CPU resources (registers)
- Requires storing "all" non provileged registers to the PCB or TCB save area
- Tricky as you need registers to do this
- All written in assembler
- Typically an architecture has a few privileged registers so the kernel can
  accomplish this

export default ({ children }) => (
  <NoteLayout meta={meta}>{children}</NoteLayout>
);
